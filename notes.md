# Ionic Notes

This file will contain my notes regarding Ionic.

All the learings are from [the docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/).

Before starting, I (perhaps foolishly or in a mundane way):
- uninstalled node, thereby uninstalling node, npm and angular
- reinstalled node (which also included npm) to its latest version
- reinstalled angular to its latest version.

This was done to update the above three to their latest versions. Ofcourse, I could have just followed the best practices to upgrade them, but my local did not have any existing project which had any dependency that needed the required changes, so I just followed the "easy way".
